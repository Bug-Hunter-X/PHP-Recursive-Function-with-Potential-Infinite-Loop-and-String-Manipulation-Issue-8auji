# PHP Recursive Function with Potential Issues

This repository demonstrates a PHP function that recursively processes data and includes a potential infinite loop scenario when dealing with circular references in the input array. It also highlights a string manipulation function that might need more robust error handling.

## Bug Description

The `processData()` function recursively iterates over an array. If the input array contains circular references (where an element refers back to itself or an ancestor), the recursive calls can continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.

Furthermore, the string manipulation using `str_replace('error', 'Error', $value)` might be overly simplistic. It only handles the specific string 'error'. More sophisticated error handling might be needed to gracefully manage various types of errors in the input data.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks to prevent infinite recursion and a more robust error handling mechanism.
